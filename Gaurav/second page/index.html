                <div class="main_info">
                    <p class="main_info-para">It was April of 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic where everybody was at
                        home, quarantining. Suddenly, there was noise around a new social networking platform called
                        ‘Clubhouse’.

                        A lot of people were talking about it on Twitter which includes a lot of hype around this
                        so-called “the new normal social app”. This is what brings Clubhouse to my attention.

                        I turned on my Twitter and stumbled upon some tweets that were talking about it. It was a great
                        discovery. Its exclusivity is what makes the platform more desired by people.

                        To get in, you needed an invite, from someone to let you in. Kinda like the frat party that
                        we’ve all attended back in college. This strategy is what brought hundreds of thousands and now
                        millions of users to the platform.

                        Conversation rooms come and go as people launch or end them.

                        The company claims that over 500,000 rooms are created per day on average. The platform also
                        claims that it records conversations as they happen but only keeps them on record if someone
                        files a complaint while the room is live.

                        If no one files a complaint, Clubhouse says it deletes the recording as soon as the host closes
                        the discussion.

                        Clubhouse kept its exclusivity vibe even long after they updated their platform to be available
                        without an invite.

                        The cool fact? It was only available for iPhones.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="main_info-head">What happened to Clubhouse?</h3>
                    <p class="main_info-para">In July of 2021, Clubhouse ended its once hyped invite system and opened
                        the app up to everyone. As of August 14, Clubhouse was the 35th most popular social networking
                        app in the App Store. It’s slightly more popular than dating apps Grindr and OkCupid, and
                        slightly less popular than Wink and Tagged

                        Clubhouse isn’t the problem, however, it’s not a once-in-a-generation idea either, despite
                        raising millions of dollars. We could assume three things why people have moved on from
                        Clubhouse.</p>
